# DownloadMagPi
Simple Python Script to download the main MagPi magazine (Windows, Linux and Mac)

Edit the main.py file, change the "output_dir" to the place you want the files stored, then set it running.
It'll open the page, check the RapsberryPi.org site for the latest issue, then download all the issues from 1 to the latest.
Anything that's already in the download folder will be skipped.

Run it each month to get the latest issue.  Something for a Cron job :)
